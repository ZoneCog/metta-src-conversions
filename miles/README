MILES is a flexible environment for tests with ILP methods
and operators authored by Irene Stahl, Birgit Tausend,
Bernhard Jung, Markus Mueller and Thorsten Volz.
It is described in the file miles/doc/docu.ps.

To run MILES, you need Quintus Prolog v3.1.1 on a Sun.
To work without the X-interface X-MILES, load the file
miles.pl. Then you have access to all operators as
specified in the file /miles/doc/SYSTEM.
To invoke X-MILES, load the file xm.pl (in prolog, NOT in qui). 
Calling xm starts the X user interface. It can be suspended
by pressing the 'Quit X-MILES'-button, and restarted by
typing again xm. Before running xm, ensure that you have
set the DISPLAY variable and the resource directory correctly
by typing

setenv DISPLAY <your-machine>:0.0
setenv XAPPLRESDIR ~/miles/xmiles_resources/

Also ensure that you have set the file search path in the file
miles.pl according to your environment.
